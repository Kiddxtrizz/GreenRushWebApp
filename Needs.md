As a social equity participant, I have first-hand experience attempting to derive information from the available sources located on the CCC Open Data portal. Based on my research, here is a list of problems many other social equity participants and I have encountered.  

1.	While the municipality zoning tracker is a valuable starting point for identifying which towns/cities cannabis businesses are allowed to operate in, there is currently no efficient method to determine the following (not limited to):
    a)	Is the municipality accepting licenses? 
    b)	How many licenses are available?
    c)	What is the license cap?
    d)	How many HCAs have been executed?
    These are essential and vital questions that all cannabis businesses need answers to.
2.	As cultivators continue to crop up, potential operators should be aware of the outstanding canopy available. 
3.	The lack of transparency around the specific zoning boundaries for a municipality makes it challenging to determine the viability of any location for cannabis businesses.

    b.	Examples

    c.	Where are the acceptable zones located? 
    
Many other problems persist and derail the plans of many potential operators; these are just some of the prevalent issues social equity participants face.
